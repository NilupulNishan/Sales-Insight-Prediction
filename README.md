## Objectives

- Analyze sales trends across time, region, and product categories  
- Evaluate the impact of discounting on profitability  
- Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques  
- Build predictive models to forecast future sales 
- Develop a professional and interactive dashboard for business users

## Project Highlights

### Data Analysis & EDA
- Seasonal sales peaks in **Novemberâ€“December**
- **Office Supplies** and **Furniture** lead in category sales
- Discounts negatively impact **Profit**

### Customer Segmentation
- Used **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** features
- Applied **K-Means clustering** â†’ 3 customer segments:
  - High-value, Mid-value, Low-value customers

### Predictive Modeling
- Built **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models  
- **Random Forest** achieved superior performance:
  - RÂ² = **0.77**
  - MAE = **92.54**
  - MSE = **68,586**

### Dashboard Insights (Power BI)
- KPI metrics: Total Sales, Profit, Orders, Customers
- Visuals: Line charts, stacked bars, maps, scatter plots
- Filters: Region, Category, Segment, Date
- Additional pages: Product performance, shipping efficiency
